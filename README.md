# Manchester_Testbed_Embedded_Controller
An intelligent embedded control and data acquisition system designed for experimental optimisation in the Manchester Ion Beam Testbed. This project integrates real-time hardware control, data logging, and machine learning–based adaptive feedback to autonomously tune experimental parameters for optimal beam performance.
